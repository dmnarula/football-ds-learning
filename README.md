# football-ds-learning
For self-learning python with a focus on football data

This repo documents my progress as I learn:
- Python for data analysis / data science
- Football-specific metrics (xG, xA, xT, PV)
- Passing networks & tracking data
- Machine learning for recruitment & performance (trying to find the next Estevao)
- Data visualization
